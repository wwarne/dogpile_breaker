    It performs the same function as the default
    `redis.asyncio.SentinelConnectionPool` implementation, in that,
    it maintains a pool of reusable connections that can be shared by
    multiple async redis clients.

    The difference is that, in the event that a client tries to get a
    connection from the pool when all of connections are in use, rather than
    raising a `redis.ConnectionError` (as the default implementation does), it
    blocks the current `Task` for a specified number of seconds until
    a connection becomes available.

    Use ``max_connections`` to increase / decrease the pool size::

    Use ``timeout`` to tell it either how many seconds to wait for a connection
    to become available, or to block forever
